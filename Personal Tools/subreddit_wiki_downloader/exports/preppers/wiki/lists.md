Most of us preppers fall into the "organized" category of personalities, but there's always room for improvement. I'm the queen of making lists and then failing to ever use them again. Here are a few that I always have going. 

### To-Do, short term

Just as it says. What I need to do in the next few weeks or month as it relates to prepping

### To-Do, long term

This is usually where larger projects go, like building a rain water retaining system, or finally expanding my garden. 

### To-Do, crisis 

This is where the rubber meets the road. My check list starts off with assessing the situation "Where are you, where is your family, where is the threat?" Then walks down the list of how to secure us and our resources, depending on the situation. Might seem stupid to have a checklist for this type of emergency, but you'd be surprised what you'll forget with enough adrenaline. 

### To take, evacuation 

This list is rather generic, and will vary widely depending on the situation at hand. I'm taking much different things if it was a hurricane or if it was an INCH situation. This list is mostly to remind me of all the small things that might be forgotten. Like shirts. I totally forgot shirts one time when evacuating from a hurricane. 

### Inventory lists 

How you manage your inventory is entirely up to you. If you use something out of a kit - like maybe your IFAK - you want to replace it ASAP. Managing a balanced pantry can also be a challenge, along with rotating it properly.

### To-purchase 

This is my favorite, budget-busting list. None of us have unlimited income, so I always keep a wish list of items I either need to buy or make to further my prepping. Some of these (like more bandages) can be worked into the grocery budget. Other items (like a generator) usually have to wait until there's a bonus from work. Having this list written down and prioritized allows you to maximize your funds and look for good deals, rather than impulse spending on prepping gear.
