Prepping isn't about stock-piling guns and generators, but about living a lifestyle to give you an edge in a disaster situation. Staying healthy and preparing to stay healthy is critical. 

###Teeth 

For the love of all things holy, brush your teeth. Go to the dentist as much as you can (within your financial/insurance ability). Don't procrastinate on cleanings. A simple cavity can quickly require a root canal if it's left unaddressed. Practice good dental hygiene, and teach your kiddos to brush/floss as well. Prep dental care items - tooth brushes, tooth paste, floss, mouthwash, etc. 

###Fitness 

Maintain some sort of physical fitness regimen. You don't have to be a gym rat or a marathon runner, but the better shape you're in, the easier it'll be to get through a situation. 


###Diet 

This shouldn't have to be said, but at least try to eat decently. Trim down the junk food, eat a vegetable every once in a while, and stock vitamins. If your preps involve a lot of beans and rice, your body should be at least familiar with eating them. If your plan involves radically shifting your diet in an emergency (IE, eating MREs), be ready for the side affects. 

###Stretching 

Along with fitness, stretch well and take care of your body. Watch your posture and avoid repetitive motion injuries. I recently was having terrible right shoulder pain - turned out, it was from continually using my right pinkie on the shift key, instead of using the shift keys on both sides of the keyboard. Little lifestyle modifications, kept me from getting an injury at work. 

###Normal check-ups 

Healthcare in America is a sticky topic, but if you've got the means to seek care, seek care. 

###Mental Health 

Maintaining good, strong mental health is crucial for every-day life, without the extra stress of a disaster situation. I'm not a therapist, but do some research on what works for YOU. If you need professional help, go and get it. If not, there's still things that you can do on a consistent basis to maintain good mental health. I personally like to focus on the little wins at work to keep me going through the day, etc.
