Information security from a preppers standpoint.

The proliferation of social media and image hosting sites is both a boon and a curse to preppers.
Boon as it allows easy contact, and dialog among those in the prepping community.  A curse as it often leaves those same preppers vulnerable to identification by those wishing or planning to do harm.  A simple picture posted of your "preps" taken with a smart phone often lead to revealing where those preps are actually stored.

With offline tools like jpeg-snoop and browser plugins like Jeffrey Friedl's Exif viewer it has become trivial to extract and view the information embedded by default in most smartphone images. Armed with this information a simple google maps query can reveal not only the location but also provide images of the location in question. That picture you took of your preps in your retreat it was smart claiming it was in Tennessee but the EXIF data shows it's in Vermont. Would you like the coordinates and driving directions? Did you just post on Facebook that you were going to the Bahamas with your family? Now I know you will not be home perhaps I should go see what I can grab from your bug out stash.  

I see many people registering domains for their blogs to prove to everyone why your freeze dried is better than their dehydrated for storage?  Don't forget to include a good privacy option in your WHOIS data. Without a privacy setting a WHOIS lookup reveals your name, phone number and address. 

Wow, just look at how many people registered for that chance to win a non-existent case of food on my blog.  Lets search popular websites for the username your email address used. Now I can correlate your real name and address with the things you post about online. Did you use the same password to register for that fake contest as the one you use for online banking?

How can you avoid these issues. For pictures either disable location information on your smartphone or save them to your computer first then open them mspaint and resave them. This will remove all EXIF data including location information.

If registering a domain always pay for the privacy option.

If you register for a contest related to any website use a generic email from a web mail provider like yahoo, hotmail or google also  use a different username and password on every site you register for.  It could be as simple as adding different numbers before or after your usual name. i.e. 98prepper07
