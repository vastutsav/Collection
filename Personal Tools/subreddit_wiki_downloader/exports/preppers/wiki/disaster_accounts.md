I am currently living in Haiti which if any of you are following the news you will know the economy and government has completely collapsed, and has been for the last couple months.

For those of you who don’t know here is the situation in a nutshell: last year the president got assassinated but there wasn’t a clear succession plan. So the Prime Minister took over after some wrangling with the other claimants. Since then the Prime Minister has stayed in power despite many calls for him to hold elections. The government had been subsidizing all fuel but were struggling to keep up with the rising price of fuel and it was really hard to get gas anywhere. So a couple months ago the government announced it was ending the subsidy. Since then there has been widespread riots and protests, looting, and road blocks. Also the gangs that are controlling the capital have besieged the only fuel port in the country. As a result hospitals are shutting down from want of electricity and medications, gas is selling for ~$30 USD a gallon, and basic food is getting hard to find. Basically, as soon as something has been sold out it’s gone.

So here are my tips:


    *have a lot of fuel stored up

    *have a small cheap motorbike; they burn less gas than a car, draw less attention, and can pass roadblocks where a car would be unable to pass.

    *live in the countryside if at all possible because food shortages and looting are more acute in the cities

    *be on good terms with your neighbours

    *have plenty of food on hand

    *download Wikipedia

    *download a library of books on all sorts of subjects (i.e. if you don’t know enough about gardening download some books on gardening.)

    *have a shortwave/AM/FM radio for getting news

    *have some alternative way of communication either a satellite communicator or HAM radio

    *have some sort of renewable energy even if it is only enough to charge a phone and run some lights

    *learn as many practical crafts as possible

    *have some good plan for cooking. If you are going to cook with wood have plenty of dry wood.

    *have some first aid skills
