Oh, yes, the bag... that thing that contains the magical stuff that's going to save our lives if/when something happens. Here's a few different types of bags that are commonly discussed in this sub, and what they normally contain:


### The Every Day Carry

The EDC is what most of us have on our person at all times. Cellphone, wallet, car keys, etc. Expand that just a little bit and carry items you may find useful throughout life, and you've got an EDC. Things like chapstick, hair ties, maybe some ibuprophen, a snack, spare tampon, etc. This is the stuff in your purse/pockets/backpack/briefcase, etc. Maybe you've got a favorite pocket knife, or always have a lighter. The prepper EDC is as slim or bulky as you want it to be, given your needs and circumstances. 

### The Bug Out Bag 

The Bug Out Bag (BOB) contains the things you'd need to survive if you left your home in a hurry. The exact contents will vary based on your needs and expected situation(s), but it could be a long-term type bag. Food, water, warmth, shelter, etc, are all concerns. When selecting items for your BOB, you need to consider where you are, where you're going, and what sort of resources you may be able to count on in that location. For example, if you're heading to the woods, you may be able to "live off the land" and want to bring the supplies to do that. 


### The Get Home Bag 

This one is for those of us planning to bug-in rather than bug-out. If you're caught in a situation away from home, these items would be the supplies required to get home, possibly on foot. Again, terrain, situations, weather, etc, all factor into the contents of the bag. If the idea is to be traveling by food, lighter is likely better than heavier, and good walking shoes are essential. This bag is not for the end of the world, but to get HOME to then face the end of the world. 

### The INCH 

INCH stands for "I am Never Coming Home." While similar to the BOB, the idea here is that you're likely never, ever returning to your home and thus must take any sort of long-term survival items with you. This may include weaponry or items purposed for re-building a home elsewhere. 

### The Refugee Bag 

In a Refugee situation, there's some sort of governmental or authoritative control of the situation, but you still want your own supplies. Some stuff may be provided, or may not be. A good example here would be a Hurricane Harvey type situation: You're at the convention center with blankets and food, but you really need (insert this) from your home. Those are the items in your refugee bag. In a controlled disaster, your BOB may quickly become a refugee bag, but the main difference here is weaponry. In a BOB or INCH situation, you'd likely want whatever weapons you've chosen to prep. In a refugee situation, weapons will likely not be allowed, and I'm sure as crap not going to stash a handgun or knife outside near a shelter location. 

### The IFAK 

This isn't really a stand alone bag, but I figured I'd include it here. The Individual First Aid Kit is basically a medical bag. The I stands for Individual, because the military issues one to each deployed member when going to a combat zone. The idea is that YOUR kit is for YOU, and you use the victim's kit on the victim. In wartime, this works. In a civilian setting, you can't expect everyone to just carry around a med bag, so it's understood that kit contents are for whomever is in need. Check out the medical page for more information. An IFAK is often part of one of the other bags. Customize your IFAK to the injuries you anticipate (IE, don't carry snake bite stuff unless you're actually in snake territory) and the things you're qualified and trained on (no NPAs or QuikClot unless you've been trained.) I also carry a "boo-boo" kit in my IFAK so that I don't have to break open the more expensive gauze if my kid gets a papercut (he's 2, it happens.)
