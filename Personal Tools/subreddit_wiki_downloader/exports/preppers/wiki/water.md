The average person needs around 2 quarts per day with moderate activity in a temperate climate. This does not include water usage for hygienic purposes. The absolute minimum that preppers tend to recommend is to have at least 1-2 gallons per person per day. A more reasonable estimate is 5 gallons per person per day if you count all your hygiene and sanitation needs: even just flushing the toilet once a day "costs" 2-4 gallons per flush. We tend to underestimate just how much water we use; the average household in the US needs around 60-80 gallons per person per day. Some of this is discretionary - long showers and such - but a lot is not.

This can quickly escalate to become what seems to be an intractable problem. A comfortable allotment for a family of four for two weeks is somewhere around 120 to 280 gallons. You can purchase [55 gallon drums](http://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/S-10757BLU/Drums/55-Gallon-Blue-Closed-Top-Plastic-Drum?model=S-10757BLU&amp;RootChecked=yes) for this storage but make sure you also purchase a pump. Or if you feel that you will still have time to fill a [WaterBOB](http://www.waterbob.com/) it can be a very good option if you are tight on space. Most of us might be able to find the storage for two weeks worth of water but not months or longer periods. Don't forget to count the water in your hot water heater (unless it's a tankless design).

Over a longer period of time you have to consider a means of filtering water for drinking. Trusted brands include Doulton, Sawyer, Lifestraw, Katadyn, and MSR. Berkey Black filters are not held to the same standard, but should be fine for day-to-day improvement of taste. Doulton filters are an NSF certified alternative that fit in Berkey housing.

Water filtration all depends on what you're filtering. For example, if you are concerned about a viral contamination of your water supply, is to get a [Sawyer Point Zero Two](http://www.sawyer.com/sawyersaves/products-pointtwo.html) which filters water to 0.02 microns. It is recommended that water be filtered to 0.1-0.2 microns before running through this sort of filter to reduce the number of cleaning cycles.


Having said all that, do not rely just on filters: many cities in the world are in arid or semi-arid climates, and urban sprawl sometimes puts you many miles from the nearest reliable source of surface water. On top of that, many types of industrial accidents can contaminate that water in ways where simple filters can't do much.

## Let's talk water quality and safety (or, no you don't have to use drinking water for everything)

&gt; I'm currently scratching my head over an incredibly ignorant comment on one of this sub's sister subreddits, which implied that using non-potable water for hygiene purposes like washing clothes and flushing toilets would be guaranteed to kill you in a survival situation.
&gt; 
&gt; Since apparently there exist aspiring preppers who actually think that, I have been annoyed into writing down an overview of what I know about reasoning about which water is safe for which purposes. 
&gt; 
&gt; # Distilled water
&gt; 
&gt; To make distilled water, you evaporate water and condense the steam. When done properly, this results in water that's completely free of any of the non-water stuff, like minerals and trace amounts of microbes, that's present in other water. Distilled water is used in chemical and medical applications and is safe to drink. 
&gt; 
&gt; The other time you may want to use distilled water is if it's going to come in contact with the insides of your sinuses or ears, such as if you use a neti pot to address congestion. Technically using boiled water is enough to kill the kinds of brain eating amoebas that occasionally make headlines (https://www.pharmacist.com/article/brain-eating-amoeba-death-highlights-importance-safe-neti-pot-use), but when distilled water is conveniently available, it can be easier than boiling water and waiting for it to cool. Yes, kind of overkill, but the slight risk of getting the brain eaten just grosses me out. 
&gt; 
&gt; # Potable, aka Drinking, water
&gt; 
&gt; Drinking water is water that's safe to drink and doesn't have any chemicals or microorganisms or other contaminants that'll hurt you. That doesn't mean free of any contaminants at all -- if you've ever bought a bottle of mineral water, you paid for the privilege of drinking water that was "contaminated" by having specific minerals dissolved in it. Depending on who you ask, these normal minerals in water are somewhere between neutral and actually good for your health. 
&gt; 
&gt; Municipal water is usually treated with trace amounts of chlorine or other chemicals -- they're amounts calculated to minimize risk of microorganisms multiplying in the water and harming people, while also minimizing risk to people of imbibing too much of them. A cup of untreated water from a municipal reservoir has too many microbes for safety; a cup of undiluted bleach has way too much bleach for safety; but by mixing them in just the right quantities we get a solution that's safer than either. 
&gt; 
&gt; The way to make non-potable water into potable water depends on what stuff is making it non-potable to begin with. Distilling is extremely energy intensive but can separate water from chemical contaminants. Boiling can kill most microbes but not physically remove any contaminants. Filtration can remove all contaminants above a certain size, including dirt and larger microbes. Chemical purification, like boiling, kills most of the microbes that can make non-potable water unsafe to drink. 
&gt; 
&gt; When you leave water sitting in a container for a while and then drink from that container, it may taste flat and "off". Try pouring the water back and forth between a couple containers, or just shaking the container, to introduce air back into the water. This usually fixes the flavor. 
&gt; 
&gt; # Non-potable water
&gt; 
&gt; Water can be non-potable for a variety of reasons, and those reasons affect what else you can use it for. 
&gt; 
&gt; ## Unknown safety
&gt; 
&gt; This is one of the biggest reasons water can be treated as non potable. Pretty much all roof catchment and surface ground water is in this category -- you just don't know what animals have introduced fecal bacteria to the body of water. In older houses, water from the pipes can be considered non-potable due to unknown safety if you aren't sure whether the house contains lead piping or not. Water stored in non-food-grade plastic containers is in a similar situation: You know the plastic might have leached chemicals into the water that would make it unwholesome to drink, and you don't have the equipment to test whether those chemicals are at safe levels. 
&gt; 
&gt; Water source | hazards to suspect or rule out
&gt; --- | --- 
&gt; direct rain catchment | bacteria from animal feces on catchment surface, chemicals from air pollution, particulate matter and chemicals if non-metal roof
&gt; rain stored in cistern | bacterial and algal growth if cistern exposed to heat or light
&gt; rivers and lakes | sediment, misc bacteria, fecal bacteria from passing animals, chemicals/fertilizers/poisons if downstream of agriculture or industry
&gt; tap water in an old house | heavy metal contamination from pipes
&gt; malfunctioning hot water heater | misc bacteria, specifically legionnaire's disease, when in doubt don't drink from the hot water tap
&gt; plastic containers like old soda bottles | algae, plastic leachate
&gt; wells | chemical or biological contamination or heavy metals; get your water tested occasionally
&gt; municipal water | risk of chemical contamination from pipes and bacterial contamination from treatment errors, get your water tested and learn where your municipality announces boil water advisories
&gt; flood water | assume every hazard on the list, especially if there's agriculture or industry upstream
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Water hazard | Treatment for drinking | Treatment for washing | Treatment for irrigation | Treatment for flushing 
&gt; ---|---|----|----|----
&gt; miscellaneous bacteria | boil, filter, or chemically treat | boil or use as-is | use as-is | use as-is
&gt; fecal bacteria | boil + filter if absolutely necessary, better to avoid, as small quantities can kill you fast | boil or chemically treat | avoid direct contact with plants, use on non-edible root zones | can be used as-is
&gt; soil or sediment | filter + treat or boil | homemade filter | use as-is | use as-is
&gt; algae | filter + treat or boil if suspected bacteria | homemade filter | use as-is | use as-is
&gt; plastic chemical leaching (non food grade containers) | ideally distill, small quantities usually won't kill you fast | use as-is | use as-is, avoid excessive or long term use | use as-is
&gt; fertilizer contamination | distill or avoid | avoid if severe contamination, probably ok to use if no look or smell | use as-is | use as-is
&gt; heavy metals | distill or avoid unless dying of thirst | usually ok | avoid long term use | use as-is
&gt; poisons | distill or avoid | avoid | avoid | could be ok if no strong odors
&gt; salt (ie sea water) | distill or avoid, google "desalination" for options | ok to use, rinse with clean water if worried | avoid | use as-is
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ## Microbial contamination
&gt; 
&gt; Water tends to have a bunch of microscopic stuff living in it. The good news is that almost all of this stuff can be rendered harmless to you with heat, chemicals, or filtration. The bad news is that if you drink water with the wrong microbes, it messes you up severely and rapidly: "you have died of dysentery" is no joke.
&gt; 
&gt; A perfect example of water with microbial contamination is rain caught from the roof of a house. A bird flies over the house and defecates on the roof; the rain washes that feces into the catchment system; and now your rain water will test positive for fecal coliform bacteria pretty much indefinitely. 
&gt; 
&gt; Ground water, like rivers and lakes, is often in this category and can also have chemical pollution depending on what's going on upstream. 
&gt; 
&gt; ### Drinking
&gt; 
&gt; Follow camping guidance like https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/backcountry_water_treatment.html to boil microbially contaminated water to make it safe to drink. 
&gt; 
&gt; ### Irrigation
&gt; 
&gt; Water that might have a bit of life in it is usually safe to water your garden with. Apply the water to the soil rather than to the plants' leaves, and the soil will filter it a bit before the plants ever get a chance to take it up. Even if you're irrigating with potable water, it's never a great idea to put irrigation water directly onto any part of a plant that you plan to eat without cooking it, like the leaves of a lettuce that you'll be having in a salad, because a damp environment encourages the various non-edible stuff floating around in the air to grow. 
&gt; 
&gt; ### Washing hands and clothes
&gt; 
&gt; If water looks and smells clean, it's usually safe to wash with, especially if you're adding soap (which will kill many microorganisms). If you have open wounds on your hands, you should probably give those a wash rinse with potable water after getting microbially contaminated water on them for any reason, though. 
&gt; 
&gt; When washing clothes, the heat and soap used will kill a lot of microbes, and then drying them in sunlight is the original UV disinfection to kill anything that might have survived. 
&gt; 
&gt; ### Cooking
&gt; 
&gt; Cooking often involves heating food with a temperature and duration that kills microbes anyways. If your cooking process would bring the water to a rolling boil for over 1 minute at most altitudes (over 3 minutes at high elevations), it'll probably kill off everything that might otherwise cause you problems (https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/backcountry_water_treatment.html). 
&gt; 
&gt; ## Chemical contamination
&gt; 
&gt; As a general rule, chemicals are a whole lot harder to get out of water than microbes are. However, most chemicals that show up in prospective drinking water are dangerous either at high concentrations or over long periods of time. 
&gt; 
&gt; ### Salt water
&gt; 
&gt; Salt water deserves special mention among chemicals because it represents so much of the water in the world. Salt isn't inherently bad for you -- hyponatremia can kill you, and salts are one of the components of the electrolyte sports drinks that people think are so healthy -- but the concentrations of salt found in seawater will kill you if you drink seawater instead of fresh water.
&gt; 
&gt; #### Drinking
&gt; 
&gt; Don't. The reason that it's bad to drink salt water is that it's saltier than your body, so it pulls fresh water toward it in your digestive system through osmosis, causing dehydration. If all you have is salt water and you need to make drinking water, some form of solar still is your best bet. 
&gt; 
&gt; #### Irrigation
&gt; 
&gt; Nope. Salt water kills most plants. If you're going to garden somewhere salty, you'll have to carefully choose salt-tolerant plant varieties. 
&gt; 
&gt; #### Washing clothes and dishes
&gt; 
&gt; Salt water can be used to clean dishes, as long as you give the eating surfaces a rinse with fresh water afterwards to keep the eating surfaces from adding salt to your food (https://www.riggingdoctor.com/life-aboard/2017/4/3/saltwater-in-the-galley). 
&gt; 
&gt; You can wash clothes in salt water, though they may have a slightly different texture afterwards (https://sailingwithbloom.com/laundry-without-a-machine/) . 
&gt; 
&gt; #### Flushing toilets
&gt; 
&gt; If you have exposed iron plumbing, this may rust your pipes over time, but ships the world over flush with salt water. 
&gt; 
&gt; ### Atmospheric contaminants
&gt; 
&gt; If you live in an area with really bad air pollution, rain and snow may not necessarily be safe to drink even with sterile catchment. My solution to this issue is to not live in such an area, so I can't speak to safety or mitigation. Just be aware that if the air is really nasty, water falling out of it will probably be nasty too. 
&gt; 
&gt; ### Algae, sediment, and DIY filtration to get them out
&gt; 
&gt; Algae is that green slime that grows in water that's exposed to light. Most algae aren't poisonous, but they make the appearance and texture of the water all nasty, and if the water has been warm enough for algae to grow it may have been warm enough for bacteria to reproduce as well. Algae and sediment can be removed from water with a homemade filter -- in a container with drainage at the bottom, put a few layers of fabric, then something fine like sand, then something coarse like gravel. Pour water with sticks and rocks and whatever in and let it percolate through, and it'll remove the big stuff that could cause issues for washing with the water. You can also use a DIY filter like this to pre-treat water for putting through your drinking water filter, and extend the life of your "good" filter by avoiding clogging it. 
&gt; 
&gt; ### Mysterious plastic leaching stuff
&gt; 
&gt; #### Drinking
&gt; 
&gt; If it's a choice between drinking water that's been stored in non food safe plastic or dying of thirst, you obviously drink the water. Most of the plastic leachate compounds that I'm aware of tend to be of the "gives you cancer if you're exposed for a long time" varieties. 
&gt; 
&gt; #### Washing anything
&gt; 
&gt; Almost certainly fine. Stuff that leaches out of plastic is bad to eat, but you're not eating your clothes and very little of what was in your water gets left behind when you wash dishes. Probably safe for hand washing as well, especially compared to the hazards of not washing your hands properly. 
&gt; 
&gt; #### Irrigation
&gt; 
&gt; Probably not ideal, but also of the "might kill you in 50 years" type of concern and thus worth risking if the alternative is to not be around in 50 years to get killed by it. 
&gt; 
&gt; #### Flushing
&gt; 
&gt; Go for it. Flushing with mysteriously non-drinkable water is fine.
&gt; 
&gt; ### Fertilizers
&gt; 
&gt; Fine for irrigation. Fine in low enough concentrations for washing stuff. Don't eat or drink them. 
&gt; 
&gt; ### Actual poisons (pesticides etc)
&gt; 
&gt; Don't put them in your food. Don't put them on your clothes or skin. Don't pour them in soil that you want to grow food in. 
&gt; 
&gt; Commenters have pointed out that in in areas which get a lot of flooding, you've gotta assume that flood water is in this category, because you have no idea what's in it. 
&gt; 
&gt; # Gray water
&gt; 
&gt; Gray water is water that you've used for something already, but haven't contaminated it with fecal bacteria. Water that you've washed clothes or dishes in, or bathed or showered in, is usually in this category. 
&gt; 
&gt; You shouldn't eat or drink this, but you can usually irrigate with it (as long as you're mindful about what chemicals like soaps and shampoos you add to it), and clean-ish gray water (like the hot water that you rinsed your clean dishes with after scrubbing them) can usually be reused for other hygiene purposes (like pre-soaking soiled clothes or linens before washing them, or flushing toilets)
&gt; 
&gt; If you've ever taken a sponge bath and washed your face first, and then washed your feet with the same water afterwards, you've reused gray water!
&gt; 
&gt; # Black water
&gt; 
&gt; Black water is wastewater contaminated with human feces, so all water from toilets and occasionally some water from bath or laundry applications. Black water has to go through a septic system and shouldn't be used directly on food plants. Black water is treated as especially hazardous because so many diseases are transmitted through feces. 
&gt; 
&gt; # Wound care and washing bandages
&gt; 
&gt; Medical supplies are a special case of laundry needs, so they deserve their own section. 
&gt; 
&gt; For wound care, sterile water or saline solution and new sterile bandages are optimal, especially for fresh wounds and any wound on an immunocompromised person. However, if the pre-packaged sterile stuff runs out, the next best thing is boiling and bleaching lint-free cotton rags (old sheets are much like actual bandages) and drying them in the sun on a hot day. This combination of heat and UV disinfection is about as close to sterile as you can hope to get at home. 
&gt; 
&gt; Killing microbes is especially important for water that'll come into contact with an open wound, so using boiled and cooled water is the safest option if there's any doubt at all about what's in the water. 
&gt; 
&gt; The book Where There Is No Doctor has great simple english explanations of how to provide medical care as safely as possible when resources are limited. 
&gt; 
&gt; # In conclusion
&gt; 
&gt; Most of these observations aren't cited because I know them from personal experience -- I grew up in a situation where we used rain catchment water for most hygiene purposes (washing, bathing, etc) and had a limited supply of well water for drinking. If you have citations or corrections you'd like me to add, I'm happy to edit.
