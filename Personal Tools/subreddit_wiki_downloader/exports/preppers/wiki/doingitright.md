Hi, Welcome to the Trailer Park.

Come sit by the campfire, have a Smore, and let's talk a bit.

There seems to be this endless trend of people saying that if you don't do these 20 things, or if you do do these 20 things, or if you don't have these 20 things, You're doing it wrong, and you're gonna die.

Alright, let me set things straight here, if you are prepping at all, you are doing something right. Just like people who are exercise, it does not matter of you are sucking wind after a walk around the block, or if you can jog a marathon before your morning coffee, you are still running miles ahead of everyone sitting on the couch, and them same is true for prepping.

If you are prepping for the big things, like end of the world, the sun bitch slapping us with solar flares, or asteroids hitting earths hemorrhoids, or climate change, or any slew of other major things that could happen, you are doing things right, because those steps you take for the big things, like back up generators, canned and freeze dried piles of water, hundreds of gallons of food, all your important documents in a near indestructible safe, all these things will help you, if something small happens as well. If a power line goes down, you have the means to have power, food, water, heat, comfort, and can easy deal with it, same holds true for anything else that comes your way. By being ready for the big things, you are also ready for the small things, so.. guess what.. you're prepping right.

You got your BOB, and VEDC ready, your route planned in case Lord of the Underworld Chthule comes out of the Oceans to slay mankind, or whatever, like maybe a dam broke and a flood is coming, or maybe just bad timing and you got a flat tire, you still have supplies on you , you have your roadside flairs, jack, spare, 4-way, and you know what, that other 150 pounds of additional tools and gear in the VEDC, means if whatever happened was worse, you would still be able to handle the situation. So.. Guess what.. You're Prepping right.

Never Once in my life did I say, as I was coasting through a hard time because I prepped for it "Well shit, we over prepared for this"

So if you have things, and you are wondering if maybe, you know, you went a little over board, don't stress about it, don't let anyone tell you, that you need to have less, because if you are prepping at all, you are prepping right.

Same holds true for the little things. Guess what, if you have that small portable generator that you have just in case there is a slight power out, and you need to have something small to power the phones, well, it does not matter if a power line went out and they will have fixed in a few hours, or the whole northern part of the state froze for a week causing power outages, you, in your home, for that prep was ready for a power out, you got your phones charged, and were able to use your small things just as you planned, and you know what, good for you! Sure, you may not have been things this was for anything big, but, it was for anything that may come. So if you were prepping at all, you were prepping right, don't let anyone steal your shine, or tell you that you are wrong.

You got a small Carry pack, or just a GHB, just in case the car dies on you, nothing major, just some things there to help you get home, like clean socks, a few cans of grape juice, and a some cereal bars, you are still rocking that situation.

You don't have a VEDC, or even know what that is, but when it comes to your car, you got your spare, jack, and 4-way, a basic tool kit, a few quarts of oil, pack of fuses, that cheap neon orange seatbelt cutter/hammer thingy, that you saw in wallyworld on sale for 2.99, and figured what the hell, why not, and handy roll of paper towels that has been there for the last 6 months, just in case, but the last time you used it was to clean up a coffee spill, you are still ready in case something happens, and there is no wrong way to prep. Some might berate you saying that it is not enough to get you away from an exploding volcano.. but.. who knows.. maybe it will be, because the only things that go wrong as you are running for your life, are things you were ready for, like a flat tire and blown fuse. As such, any prep you get, anything you add, anything you are doing.. is a good prep.

Keep at it, and don't let anyone discourage you.

Now, hope you enjoyed the campfire chat.
