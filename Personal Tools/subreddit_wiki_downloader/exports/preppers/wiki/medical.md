## How to Become Prepared: Medical

There are some great books that can help you become prepared for medical situations during emergencies. [Where There Is No Doctor](https://store.hesperian.org/prod/Where_There_Is_No_Doctor.html) and [Where There Is No Dentist](https://store.hesperian.org/prod/Where_There_Is_No_Dentist.html) are two guides originally written for remote rural villages where there is no medical access. [The Survival Medicine Handbook: A Guide for When Help is Not on the Way](https://www.amazon.com/Survival-Medicine-Handbook-Guide-When/dp/0988872536) was written specifically for the prepper community and is very comprehensive. The [authors also have a very good YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/drbonespodcast) where they cover many medical topics.

### Every day health


The best way to care for an injury or illness is to prevent it in the first place. Basic hygiene and sanitation practices may be difficult in a disaster situation, but are critical to maintaining health. Make sure that plans for sanitation and cleanliness are included in your prepping. 

Common every-day type events can be taken care of by over-the-counter products. Stock what you use, don't go overboard on this one. Basic painkillers, anti-histamines (Benadryl), anti-diarrheals, de-congestants, etc, can help overcome symptoms that would otherwise hamper the ability to be productive. If your family needs a certain item (like children's Tylenol), then stock it. Take care to rotate supplies and be careful of expiration dates. While most food products can be eaten past expiration dates, medicine can go through chemical changes that render the medication less effective or even toxic. Including multi vitamins can also be a good way to augment a prepper's pantry and fill any dietary gaps. 

Some major medical problems can present similar symptoms to every-day ailments at first. Get familiar with diseases that run in your family, and ailments with environmental risk factors in your part of the world. Seek treatment for medical and dental conditions as soon as possible while you have access to hospitals, and prepare for local or regional disasters in which you have to evacuate to part of the world in which the medical care you need is available.

Pre-event diet and exercise can greatly improve your ability to handle a situation. If you're not already exercising regularly (whatever sort of work out routine works for you), today's a great day to start. A well-maintained and healthy body is a lot easier to heal than one that's already struggling. 

Situational awareness is also critical. Watch your surroundings, anticipate issues, and do your best to avoid injuries. This is especially critical if you're in a new or unfamiliar situation, or a rapidly changing situation. Both are common during and after disaster events. 


### Basic First Aid

####Airway &amp; Breathing

Human tissue, including the brain, dies when it gets deprived of oxygen and nutrients for too long. In a trauma situation, rescuers need to make sure that: 

* Air is able to go into and out of the patient's lungs
* The patient's blood is going around their circulatory system

How do you make sure the air is going in and out? Take a CPR class to learn basic airway correction, rescue breathing, chest compressions, and treatment for choking. A CPR or first aid class can also explain how to place an unconscious patient into the recovery position to prevent them from compromising their own airway later if they vomit. 

How do you make sure the blood is circulating? Heart problems are a whole can of worms that you should talk to your doctor about before the apocalypse, and relocating to part of the world with ambulances and hospitals in working order is the best way to guarantee survival in the event of a heart attack. Circulation can also be compromised if too much blood is leaving the patient, and thanks to the military we have a lot of options to keep the blood in.

####Bleeding Control

There are 3 main types of bleeding: Capillary, Venous, and Arterial. 

Capillary is like a paper cut - blood oozes out, but is easily controlled. Main risk here is not blood loss, but infection. Stop the bleeding, clean if needed, cover and dress.  
Venous bleeding is a cut on a vein, the blood coming back to the heart. This is dangerous, but not quite as bad as arterial bleeding. Blood will normally be darker in color and flowing somewhat steadily rather than spurting out. Treat as spelled out below. If a victim has multiple wounds, prioritize the arterial bleeding. 

Arterial bleeding is the most dangerous of the three. This is blood coming directly from the heart, and being pumped throughout the body. A cut in an artery, along with the force of a human heart, can cause a patient to bleed out rapidly. Arterial bleeding is noted by bright red, oxygenated blood, and is normally coming out in spurts with the victim's heartbeat. Bleeding must be stopped as quickly as possible, using the steps below. 

Direct pressure on a bleeding wound is the most effective way to control bleeding. Always be sure to wear gloves when dealing with someone that is actively bleeding, the gloves will protect you from contracting bloodborne diseases. Use sterile gauze to cover the wound and then apply direct pressure to the bleeding wound to stop the bleeding. If the bleeding continues place another sterile gauze pad over the one that is already there. DO NOT REMOVE THE FIRST ONE. If you remove the first layer of gauze you will remove the clot that has started to form. 

Next steps involve elevation and pressure points. Elevate the limb (if possible) above the level of the heart. This allows gravity to assist in keeping the blood away from the wound. Make sure not to further injure the patient if moving them, though. For example, someone with a broken back and bleeding leg likely shouldn't be moved at all. Direct pressure can also be applied to the artery feeding the affected limb. [These pressure points](http://brooksidepress.org/Products/OperationalMedicine/DATA/operationalmed/Manuals/Standard1stAid/chapter3.html) are often located on the inside of joints, where the artery and bone are closest, without much muscle in the way. Completely stopping the flow of blood is not necessary, simply slow down the blood enough that direct pressure on the wound and the natural clotting capability will be effective. Cutting off blood flow entirely has the same affect as a tourniquet. 


If bleeding continues use a commercial tourniquet. [suggested tourniquet](https://www.narescue.com/combat-application-tourniquet-c-a-t). A tourniquet can stay on a limb for up to 4-6 hours without serious risk of damage to the limb.  If bleeding is not controlled with the first tourniquet use a second tourniquet above the first. Tourniquets are only used to control limb bleeding. Once a tourniquet is applied, mark the patient's forehead with a T (with a sharpie or their own blood) and the time the tourniquet was applied. Never, EVER remove a tourniquet once it's in place, as that can dislodge the blood clot and allow the clot to travel through the body, killing the patient either by bleeding out, or by a clot in the lungs or brain. Seek professional medical attention as soon as possible. 

QuikClot is a popular prepping item, but should only be used as an absolute last resort. The chemicals in QuikClot will chemically cauterize the wound, sealing the artery, but can do significant damage to the surrounding tissue. It must be surgically removed by a medical professional. If all other methods of bleeding control don't work, then QuikClot can save a life. However, if professional medical attention is not available quickly, the patient can be worse off. Take care not to let the quikclot make contact with any other bodily fluids, and don't touch it directly with skin. Always wear gloves while using, and pack the wound completely. 

Contrary to internet rumors, tampons are NOT a good way of controlling bleeding. Tampons absorb blood, but do not assist with clotting or sealing a wound. The tampon will stop blood from coming out of the victim's body, but instead the victim is bleeding out internally. The care-giver sees no more blood and assumes that the wound is taken care of, when the patient is actually in worse condition than they were with an open wound. In a pinch, sanitary pads can be used as a dressing or to apply direct pressure, but do not use tampons. 



### Trauma Kits

### Preventing Infection

Study how infection works, and preventing it becomes mostly common sense. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi are present in trace amounts on pretty much everything in the world, but unbroken human skin keeps usually keeps them from harming the body. If the skin is broken, the immune system tries to remove any contaminants. 

First, minimize the populations of microbes available to contaminate a wound. Physically remove them by washing with soap and hot water. The hazard of using antibacterial products on a daily basis is that only those microbes which are resistant to the product will survive, and then they're harder to get rid of. Sanitize anything that you plan to touch a wound with using heat, chemicals, or even sunlight. 

Second, support the body's natural processes that fight infection. When you get a minor injury, allowing it to bleed briefly before halting the bleeding can help carry any contaminants out of the wound. Good nutrition, hydration, sleep, and general physical fitness all help the immune system function properly.

Third, recognize the signs of infection and seek treatment if you suspect that you have one. Community members with medical training can be a good resource in a disaster scenario, as can international aid workers if the disaster is regional. In some disasters, it may be possible to seek medical advice over communications such as amateur radio if there's no better option available. 

#### Antibiotics

Taking antibiotics without the supervision and consent of a doctor is not advised. Some preppers elect to stockpile antibiotics in the event that modern medicine is not available. Should you choose to do this, do your own research and do it at your own risk. 

Antibiotics are used when you have a bacterial infection that your body cannot manage on its own. Antibiotics do not treat viruses such as the cold or flu. Most of the time, you don't need antibiotics because your immune system can handle infections on it's own. There are types of infections that your body might not handle and medical professionals have determined that using antibiotics is the safest course of action. If you are prone to infections and you regularly get prescribes antibiotics, having those antibiotics on hand in case of a long term emergency might be a good idea.

### Wound Packing
Written and graciously shared by u/macgyvermedical

Hi folks!

I'm a registered nurse, physical diagnosis instructor, and wilderness and remote first aid instructor. I was checking out some of the first aid kit lists on this sub, and I saw something I found interesting- a lot of people mention having or wanting to have a suture kit as a prep, conceivably as a way to treat wounds in a low-resource environment.

And I see the appeal- the ability to provide definitive care (all the care needed for a particular illness or injury) for something as common as a wound in a low-resource environment would be incredibly helpful. After all, if professional medical care is scarce or difficult to find, you want to be able to take care of smaller things on your own without having to involve professionals who may be stretched thin.

Unfortunately, despite being relatively common in modern medical settings, suturing is probably not the definitive care you're looking for in a backcountry or SHTF situation. It's painful without local anesthetic, requires very specific training to do well, basically only has the advantage of a smaller scar, and unless used on a very specific type of wound, can cause a life-threatening complication I'll discuss below. Fortunately, there are easier, cheaper, and safer ways of providing the same or better definitive care for wounds in a low-resource environment.

As with any medical situation to which you are the first to respond, you want to make sure you are safe. Is the cougar who just chomped down on your buddy's leg now draped luxuriously on a nearby rock? You need to recognize and take care of that first before you can help. Same with massive jagged icicles hanging overhead, someone with a gun, rocks in danger of falling, and the like.

Once you've got that- is there anything that's gonna kill your patient before the wound does? Unless actively spurting blood, wounds are low, low, low on the priority list. You're gonna wanna make sure they're conscious, breathing, have a pulse, and aren't spurting blood (and take care of those things) before you get into the nitty gritty of actually treating that wound. You would not believe how many dead people come into the emergency department with perfectly splinted arms because someone noticed an obvious break but didn't notice that they needed to start CPR. Panic will do that to a person.

So now that you and your patient are not in immanent danger of death, the wound itself. First, you're gonna want to assess it. Look at how big it is, is it still bleeding, is it dirty, how did it happen? If it's a simple cut that's less than a half inch deep, and gaping less than a quarter inch, and relatively clean looking, congrats! This might be a candidate for closure you can do yourself. And by that, I mean duct tape, silk medical tape (this is my fav), super glue, or steri-strips.

To apply these, first wash the wound. This is gonna suck. Wash your hands first and if you have it, give 1,000mg tylenol and 800mg ibuprofen (after this wait at least a half hour to get started). The nice thing is that any water you'd be comfortable drinking can be used to irrigate a wound. You wanna pressurize it somehow (my fave is by poking a hole in the top of a disposable water bottle and squeezing to create a jet of water), but you can also use an irrigation syringe, enema bottle, nitrile glove or ziploc bag with a hole in it if that's what you've got. Hold the edges of the wound apart, and spray until any visible debris is gone. If there's pieces of dirt stuck in there that can't be removed via irrigation, use your clean, (preferably gloved) fingers or clean gauze to remove it and re-irrigate.

Is the wound still bleeding? The answer is probably yes, since cleaning a wound well will remove any progress the wound has made towards clotting. That's normal and okay. Put direct pressure overtop of the wound with a clean piece of gauze or cloth to stop the bleeding and make it easier to close the wound.

Once the wound is clean and the edges are dry, cut strips of your tape into 1/4-1/2in x 2in segments. On one side of the wound, lay about half a strip of the tape perpendicular to the wound. Pinch the edge of the wound closed with your fingers, stretch the tape over it, and stick the rest to the other side. Space these 1/4-1/2in apart along the wound, leaving space in between for drainage. It should look like this. After that, you can cover it with gauze and tape it in place, changing as needed. (NOTE: if you're using super glue, if the wound is long, dot the glue every half inch or so, leaving space in between for drainage. If the wound is short, at least leave an opening at one end for drainage.)

What if the wound is bigger than that? Or so dirty you can't clean it with irrigation and light debridement? Or a puncture wound (gun/knife/animal bite/etc...) you can't get to the bottom of? Well you're definitely not going to want to close that. Even in a hospital setting, we don't close very dirty, very large, or heavily draining wounds.

We pack them instead.

NOTE: You can use packing for two different things regarding wound care. There's packing that you might do in an emergency to stop bleeding (packing in the wound can provide the opportunity to apply more direct pressure to the specific bleeding blood vessel) and there's packing that is used to hold the wound open, keep it warm, and wick drainage away from the wound bed. This post is about the second kind. By the time you're here, your bleeding should have already stopped.

The best way for a wound to heal is from the bottom up, in a clean, warm, moist environment. If you close the top of a deep wound, even if you've cleaned it well, the skin will close first and trap drainage, dead tissue, and any dirt you didn't get in a pocket below the skin. This can cause severe, life-threatening infection even with antibiotics, and will absolutely need to be opened and re-drained, re-cleaned, and packed to heal correctly. It's way easier to just pack it right the first time.

Clean the wound as well as you can, same way as above with pressurized potable water and clean gloved hands/gauze if needed. Then you're going to dampen strips of cloth with potable water. Keep track of the number of strips/pads you use so that you know you've taken them all out next time. In a hospital we use a product called kerlix, which comes as a roll of rough gauze, but you can use gauze pads (not ABD/trauma pads- save these to go over wounds), or strips of clean wool or cotton (bedsheet-type fabric works great, but no t-shirt or stretchy/knit if possible) if that's what you've got. With gloved hands, pack the dampened cloth as deep in the wound as you can and fill it to the top. It should look like this. Cover that with an ABD pad, write the date, time, and number of pieces of cloth in the wound on it, and tape in place.

About 1-2 times per day, you want to take the packing out of the wound, get new packing (or clean and boil the packing you have (for about 10 mins) if it's in short supply), irrigate the wound, and re-pack. When the packing comes out, especially for dirty wounds, it's gonna look gnarly and probably stick to the dead tissue, which hopefully will easily come out with it. That's what you want. If it's sticking really hard, loosen it with some potable water- hopefully it will come out in the next packing cycle or so.

Over time, the wound will close from the bottom up. You are purposefully holding it open so it can do this without creating pockets of infection that can kill the person later. The base of a well-healing wound should look like this, possibly with some whitish "slough" tissue that is removed with the packing. Signs that the wound is not healing well is the person having a fever beyond the first day or so, the area around the wound becoming red and hot, black tissue in the wound that isn't coming out with the packing, foul smell, and puss-filled white/green drainage. These are signs that you need to go to a higher level of care or the person's life might be in danger.

Generally speaking, though- packing a wound is definitely substantially less risky than suturing, and a lot of the time, it is the best home-based definitive care for a wound if you don't have access to professional medical care.
