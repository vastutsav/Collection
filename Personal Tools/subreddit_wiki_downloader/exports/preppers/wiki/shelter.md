Shelter is the second item in the [Survival Rule of Threes](/r/preppers/wiki/rule_of_threes) - You can survive for three hours without shelter in a harsh environment. Both hypothermia and hyperthermia are immediate concerns when exposed to extreme cold or heat but shelter can also protect you from things such as lightning, flooding, animal or insects, airborne pollutants, or even other humans. 

* Bug In Shelter

New preppers often start out by building a [Bug Out Bag](/r/preppers/wiki/bags) but they overlook one of the most important preparations that they already have: their home. Your home already protects you from the elements and in most events you should look to it as your first option for shelter. Stockpiling two weeks worth of [food](/r/preppers/wiki/food) and [water](/r/preppers/wiki/water) and making sure you can supply for your [energy](/r/preppers/wiki/energy) needs is probably the easiest way to start. Also, there are several [security](/r/preppers/wiki/security) considerations that you might want to consider adding. 

You will also want to make sure that you are equipped to get back to your home if you are away when something happens. Keeping a [Get Home Bag](/r/preppers/wiki/bags) in our vehicles/office/school will help you get back to a safe location.

Next, making sure that your home is prepared to deal with adverse weather, natural disasters, and other events is a good way to make sure you and your family will be safe in case of common disasters. If you live in an area prone to earthquakes and have an older home you can consider getting a seismic retrofit. If you live in an area that is prone to tornadoes or hurricanes, you will want to make sure you have supplies to board up windows. If wildfires are a concern, keeping bush cleared from around your home.

* Bug Out Shelter

In the case that the risk of dying becomes greater if you stay in your home than if you leave, then it is time to bug out. A bug out plan should include a plan to go to a predetermined destination; your bug out location where you have a permanent or semi-permanent shelter. But on the way there you will need temporary shelter. This could be a tent, tarp, bivy sack, recreational vehicle, converted truck or van, or any other shelter that you can bring with you. What you take will depend on what your bug out plan is. You will want to make sure that your shelter is appropriate for all seasons (or you have seasonally appropriate options to choose from). If you anticipate that there might be large numbers of people fleeing the same area you are or might be heading to the same area you are, choosing a shelter that [does not stand out](/r/preppers/wiki/grey_man) so that you are not as noticeable can help keep you safe.
