###Welcome!

You're probably here because, like all the rest of us, there's something tingling your spider senses right now. Whether it's COVID, a recent weather event, a financial impact, or worse, we're all in this together.  

Welcome to our little corner of the internet. 

Prepping can be as basic or as complicated as you make it, and should be tailored to your unique situation. I recommend a balanced approach - covering all of your bases and slowly increasing everything rather than going hog-wild in one area. 

What sort emergencies are you most susceptible to?  
What sort of natural disasters are common in your area?   
How is your household composed, and what extra needs do you have? (IE, prepping for babies/elderly/etc).  
How are your finances?  
What sort of medical issues does your family face? 
What sort of disaster-related commitments exist within your family? Is someone a nurse/first responder/NationalGuardsman/on the Emergency Management team at work?

Start with 72 hours of independence. What would it take for you to hunker down in your own home and survive for 72 hours? Chances are, you're already part of the way there. Food, shelter, water, medication, etc. 

Then, move those goal-posts to a week of shelter-in-place independence. For most of us, that means adding in some canned goods, granola bars, and maybe some bottled water. Buy and store the things that you'd normally eat any way, just in a preserved format. If you don't like tuna, don't stock tuna, etc.

###The Balanced Approach 

Just as with life, approaching prepping with balance and a bit of grounded-ness is important. As you start to prepare beyond a 72 hour kit, do so evenly across all areas of life. The pantry, finances, health, skills, community, security, etc, are all important in their own ways. 

For example, all the guns in the world will do you no good if you haven't got any food. 30 years worth of food isn't gonna help if you can't clean out a wound. And none of this matters if you can't pay your rent/mortgage. 

As you start to invest time and money into prepping, be realistic about the possible hazards your family will face, and be realistic about how to prepare for them. 

###Most of us aren't prepping for zombies 

I prep for the boring things - a hurricane, roof leak, financial emergency, COVID, etc. Boring, mundane, situations that happen to every-day people. I don't prep for nuclear war or for an EMP because they're simply unlikely to happen. But having bandages on hand for a deep cut? An extra can of gas? An extra bag of dog food? Absolutely. 


###Don't get caught up in "Prepper LARPing" 

Live Action Role Play, where grown adults put themselves into fantasy situations for the adventure and entertainment of it. Perfectly normal for a hobby, downright dreadful for prepping. The idea of heading into the woods with a backpack, a rifle, and "roughing" it sounds like an adventure, but in an actual disaster situation, it's likely the exact opposite of what should be done. If you seek adventure, absolutely chase those dreams, but don't confuse that with being ready for a true adventure. Same goes with "disaster porn", or anything that celebrates the destruction of property and/or regular livelihoods.
