#Efficiency

## Resource consumption

### Water

The average adult American consumes over 100 gallons of water a day. Showering, dishes, laundry, other cleaning activities (car washing, etc) and lawn/garden maintenance add up, and add up quickly. The "standard" prepper advice is to store 1-2 gallons of water, per person per day, for an expected event. While you can make it work on 1 or 2 gallons, be prepared to conserve carefully for the other 99 gallons. 

#### Showering 
Showering has become an every day luxury. Be prepared to go without showering, take sponge baths, or shower with a very thin drip of cold water. It's possible to completely shower with 1 quart of water - I've done it while deployed. Using only just enough soap, carefully scrubbing, and rinsing efficiently, everything got clean. It wasn't fun or pretty, but then again, neither is any situation without water. 

#### Collecting grey water 
Grey water is any waste water that doesn't have fecal mater in it. This can be re-used for flushing, cleaning "dirtier" items, or put into the garden. If you've ever washed your face first, then used the same water to wash your feet, you've re-used grey water. The water you used to shower could also be used to wash your clothes. 

## Within the home

This page focuses on increasing the energy efficiency of your home with a goal of reducing your fuel/electricity consumption and reducing your carbon footprint. For those contemplating a solar array for power generation, you'll want to take this advice into consideration before purchasing your system, as you'll get a much higher cost:benefit ratio from these approaches.

###Heat loss

A good general principle of heat loss is to imagine each room in your house as a compartment of air, and then to try to stop transfer of heat from within that container to the outside. To that end, there are 3 main types of heat loss in a building: 1) Convection, or air carrying heat across barriers, 2) Conduction, or materials carrying heat across barriers, and 3) Radiation, or materials emitting stored heat from a barrier. Convection is usually the largest source of heat loss, although this isn't always the case.

First step is to seal your air barrier, usually your walls and wall openings. Buy a case of spray foam, and go to town. Take the trim off of every door and window, fill the gaps between the frame and door/window. Spray around plumbing openings under your sink. Buy outlet gaskets and put them on every light switch and outlet. Caulk crown molding, especially if you live in a mobile home. Sneakier gaps can be found by holding a lighter near wall joints and seeing where air is moving.

Next step is to add insulation wherever possible. For attics, use blown cellulose, not fiberglass, as fiberglass does a horrible job of stopping air movement (convection). Check joist bays between floors to ensure that they are sealed up, or else cold air can move between your ceiling and 2nd story floor, losing you a ton of heat. Basically you want every part of the outer surface of your air barriers covered with insulation. Find your local community action program agency, every county will have one, and ask for weatherization. They'll do most of this for you for free if your income is low enough.

If you're designing a house to build, try to incorporate some earth-shielding. Soil maintains a steady 54 degrees below 4 feet year-round, which provides free heat in winter and cooling in the summer.

###Lighting

Replace all incandescent bulbs with LED bulbs, which use 10% of the energy and last three times as long. Maximize solar heat gain and natural lighting by installing as many south-facing windows as you can (if you live in southern hemisphere, north-facing). Strategically placed deciduous trees on the south side will shield light and heat in the summer with leaves, and allow light/heat in winter when they fall off, providing passive heating and cooling.
