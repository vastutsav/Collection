Land Navigation, in both urban and wilderness settings, are important skills to have. Whether you're preparing for your car to break down/run out of gas in a rural environment, natural disaster evacuation, post disaster search and rescue, back country hiking/hunting/whatever, or just everyday life, you may very well find yourself unable to navigate with you cell phone. Any of these situations you may have a dead cellphone, a desire to preserve the battery, no service, cell towers could be down due to damage or inundated with traffic it is important to understand how to use a map and compass as well as any other navigation tools and techniques. The following will hopefully provide some guidance on how to get better at this skill.

### How to use a compass to get a heading, deal with declination, and step count

Graciously written by u/whatamidoinglol69420, originally posted [here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/nvyu7v/how_to_use_a_compass_to_get_a_heading_deal_with/)

In my previous post (link to it here), I went over how to do resection and back-azimuths. As it was rightly pointed out, I glossed over some of the "basic" things, which are actually more complex than I gave them credit. So, here is a quick guide on how to shoot an azimuth using a compass, how to translate a heading from a compass to a map and back (declination), and how to navigate for a distance using your step count.

Start by making sure you have a good, quality compass.

Next, familiarize yourself with these terms.

True North (also known as Geographic North): "North according to the earth's axis, not magnetic north."
Magnetic North: "the direction in which the north end of a compass needle or other freely suspended magnet will point in response to the earth's magnetic field. It deviates from true north over time and from place to place because the earth's magnetic poles are not fixed in relation to its axis."
Grid North: "The direction northwards along the grid lines of a map projection. The grid north for a particular map is usually chosen so that it deviates very little from the true north."
"The deviation of the compass from true north is an angle called "declination" (or "magnetic declination")." https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-declination

Then, on a USGS topographic map you will see some geometry - a straight line with a star, then another arrow line with GN and another arrow with MN. The star is True North, GN is Grid North and MN is Magnetic North. These numbers show the angle differences between true, geographic, and magnetic North from the center of the map sheet. You must use them when calculating your headings.

"Whenever you transfer a magnetic bearing taken in the field to your map, you add the magnetic declination to get the true bearing."

Here is a good illustrated guide I found, which also shows different ways to hold the compass when getting a bearing: https://www.semo.edu/pdf/showmegold_Basic_Land_Navigation.pdf

To keep it simple:

If you have a fancy compass, you can adjust the declination on it directly to avoid math. Most don't so I will show how to do it manually but the link above shows how to put a declination on a compass.

Say we want to translate a real world magnetic heading onto our map.

Take your compass. Hold it up to your cheek at eye level and "shoot" an azimuth. Observe the degree. Let's say you're aiming at a hill off in the distance and it's at a bearing of 118 degrees. That's 118 degrees from Magnetic North.

Observe the declination as shown on your USGS map. An east declination is a positive number (or addition) and a west declination is a negative number (or subtraction).

Let's say our declination is 5 degrees and it's on the east (right) side of the true north arrow. We add 5 degrees, so 118 + 5 = 123. When we look on the map, the hill is 123 degrees from our position (on the map). That is if we are plotting a course using a protractor, we'd use 123. If we use 118 (real world magnetic heading) the line won't match up with the hill on the map. If the declination was due west (left side) we'd subtract 5 (or add negative 5) and end up with 113 degrees.

Now let's say we know where we are on the map but there's really not any notable features. Waaaay off in the distance there is some building but it's miles and miles away through forested terrain. We can't "aim" our compass at the building - we can't see it. We plot a course on the map from our known starting position. Let's say we find out the building is 10 miles due 45 degrees on the map. How do we know the distance? There is a line on the bottom, which shows the scale. On a 1:24,000 scale map 1 inch is equal to 2000 feet and 1 centimeter is 240 meters. Check here for more details: https://pubs.usgs.gov/unnumbered/70039582/report.pdf

But the declination is something fierce here, like 12 degrees East. So if we just start booking it at 45 degrees we'd end up somewhere totally different and not the building we want.

Do we want to do 45 + 12? No, we are going from the map to real world. So we invert - we do the opposite. So we subtract 12 if its 12 degrees due east or we subtract a negative (same as adding a positive) if it's due west. Remember that in our previous example, when going from magnetic to the map, we would have added 12 if due east and subtracted it if due west. In this case we are going from the map to magnetic North. Our declination is 12 degrees due East, so we subtract: 45 - 12 = 33 degrees. If it was due West we would do 45 - (-12) = 45 + 12 = 57 degrees.

Let's stick with East though for the remainder of this example. When we use our compass, we'd hold it to our cheek and look for 33 degrees, pick some tree or notable rock/landmark that we can see and head there. Once we reach it, we re-shoot a 57 degree heading at another. I highly recommend this method, don't just shoot a 57 degree heading and walk 10 miles because our sense of what constitutes a "straight line" walk is totally wrong and there will be obstacles to navigate in a forest or even urban environment.

So pick out where you want to stop ahead of time. Let's say a cool looking dead tree that you can't miss. That way you can go around big rocks, do whatever you need to to get there. Once you do you know you're on the right track. Re-shoot your heading to another notable spot and keep doing that until you reach your destination. The thicker the vegetation, the more you will need to re-shoot the azimuth/heading, which is OK. Just be patient and trust it.

It is also helpful to know your step count. What is a step count? How many steps it takes you to walk 100 meters. It differs from flat to rough terrain. It also differs between day and night. You should know all of them. Don't guess or use an average. Know what your specific step count is by measuring it.

https://www.armystudyguide.com/content/army_board_study_guide_topics/land_navigation_map_reading/how-to-use-pace-count-to-.shtml

Count each step as you walk. It's tedious but I find it's necessary. If you know your destination is 1 kilometer away, that's 10 * 100 meters. Let's say vegetation is sparse and you have visibility every 100 meters or so. Shoot a heading of 33 degrees. Count to your step count as you walk (let's say 130 steps). Do that ten times. Are you not at your destination? Something went wrong but you should be reasonably close because you followed your step count. If you didn't and just kept walking hoping to see it - how do you know if you over or under shot it and by how much?

If you followed your step count and you know you walked around 1km in the right direction, you can "canvas" the area. Leave something notable first at the place you arrive that was supposed to be the building. Walk 100 meters left. Do you see it? No. Walk back to your starting place don't try to circle. Now walk forward 100 meters. Do you see it? No. Go back to the marked starting point. Walk right 100 meters. Do you see it? Oh yeah it's about 150 meters farther right.

One user suggested to pick either left or right of your target and go that way instead, so that you know what side the target should be on. If you intentionally overshoot very left of the building, then you walk right to find it eventually, so you don't have to do the left, center, right method above. That may work too. Whatever you find works best for you.

Please share your experience with land navigation, especially if you have dealt with adjusting for declination and step count; any tips are appreciated!
