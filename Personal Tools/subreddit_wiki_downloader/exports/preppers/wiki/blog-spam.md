If your account is shadowbanned your submission will be confirmed as spam and removed. The moderators of /r/preppers may message or comment to inform you of your status at their discretion. It is your responsibility to [contact the Reddit administrators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com) to correct your status â€” the moderators of /r/preppers can't do anything.

If you participate on Reddit regularly and occasionally submit links to your own content you can ignore this rule so long as you are following proper [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). **Otherwise if you are promoting your own content you can submit a link once per 2 weeks.** This is measured by the date of your most recent submission. If it says '14 days ago' you can submit a new link.

If a submitter breaks the rules and it is verified they will receive one warning via a private message. A second violation will result in being banned from /r/preppers.

If you have a question about this policy please send [modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fpreppers) to the /r/preppers moderators.
