### How to Become Prepared: [Medical](/r/preppers/wiki/medical) &gt; Antibiotics

####Why would I want to add antibiotics to my preps??####

Antibiotics are used when you have a bacterial infection that your body cannot manage on its own. Antibiotics do not treat viruses such as the cold or flu. Most of the time, you don't need antibiotics becasue your immune system can handle infections on it's own. There are types of infections that your body might not handle and medical professionals have determined that using antibiotics is the safest course of action. If you are prone to infections and you regularly get prescribes antibiotics, having those antibiotics on hand in case of a long term emergency might be a good idea.

####Should you stockpile antibiotics??####

For most short to medium length events, you probably don't need to. If it is reasonable to think that you will be able to get to a place that has medical facilities, you can probably safely skip stockpiling antibiotics. If you think that you will be unable to reach medical facilities for more than a few months and that there is a high chance of getting an infection, then you might want to consider having some antibiotics on hand. But more importantly, you will need to also be able to correctly identify which antibiotics you need to take and when. More on that below.

####What is antibiotic resistance and do I need to worry about it in a SHTF event?####

Antibiotic resistance is the tendency for bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics due to over exposure. While this is happening broadly around the world as societies over-prescribe antibiotics or as they are over used in agriculture, antibiotic resistance can also happen on a more individual level too. [Neosporin and other antibacterial ointments may be one of the factors behind the spread of an especially lethal strain of MRSA](https://www.webmd.com/children/news/20110914/study-antibiotic-ointments-may-spread-of-mrsa). Taking the wrong type of antibiotic, or incorrect dose for a given infection, or taking them when you don't actually have an infection or you misdiagnose an infection, can lead to those antibiotics become less effective or not at all effective the next time you need them.

####What are the other dangers that the misuse of antibiotics can cause??####

Lots of people will try to self-diagnose things like ear infections. They will tell you that they treated themselves with antibiotics and the ear infection went away. The problem is that very often their pain was caused by a virus, not bacteria. ***Antibiotics have no effect on viruses.*** If you do this, you become a breading ground for antibiotic resistant bacteria.

Worse than that, antibiotics can cause adverse reactions or severe allergic reactions. Broad spectrum antibiotics also attack the beneficial bacteria that we all have in us that live in our intestines. Misuse of antibiotics can have significant effects on them which can effect your ability to extract nutrients from your food along with other consequences.

Sure, the risk of letting an infection running its course during a long term SHTF event is not good, but the risk of other issues if you misuse them is also a threat. Antibiotics should be an absolute last resort, and most people, when they are dealing with pain cannot be fair judges of when the right time to take antibiotics is. If you are going to have add antibiotics to your preps you need to also have adequate documentation of when and how to take them. And preferably, you need someone else to administer the diagnostics to make that determination so you don't take them unnecessarily. 

####Which kinds should I store and do I need to rotate my supply??####

The most important thing here is that not all infections need to be treated with antibiotics. And one type of antibiotic might not work against all types of bacteria. 

####Are animal and fish antibiotics safe to take??####

We don't really know. Some sources point out that animal grade antibiotics are usually manufactured in the same facilities as human grade antibiotics but there is no guarantee of their safety. **No one should think of taking animal antibiotics except as a last resort when you do not have access to emergency medical care.** And if you do need to, be careful in taking them as the dosage might be different that the antibiotics you would get from the pharmacy and taking too much or too little when you need them can be detrimental. Many states are starting to ban the sale of things animal antibiotics to the general public without a prescription from a veterinarian due to the public misusing them (typically inappropriate self medication for things like colds and viruses leading to the possible further spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria.)

So no one is going to tell you that they are safe, but it might be safer than not taking them. Do your research and make the most informed choice you can.
