# Basics

# FRS
For most people, a good set or FRS (Family Radio Service) radios is all you need to talk with your local group. The Motorola T series or Midland's X-talker fits the bill. Power is limited to 2 watts and distances are limited to ~1 mile in an urban setting, if you're lucky. A set of radios should cost ~$30-50 but can go up to a few hundred based on advanced features (Bluetooth, waterproofing, etc).

#GMRS
The next step up in functionality is GMRS (General Mobile Radio Service). There is a license involved, but it's only $35, lasts 10 years, and covers anyone operating with you. GMRS gives you access to several advanced features like repeaters, off-set frequencies, and tones. GMRS is also allowed to use more power and much larger antenna when operating. For the average r/preppers, this is about as far as you probably need to go if you aren't interested in the dark arts of radio. Power is limited to 50 watts with distances getting a bit better and can be enhanced by using a repeater; though not anything like the movies. It's cheap, effective, and many of the radios come with NWS weather band built in. A set of radios should cost ~$40-60, a mobile or base station &gt;$100, or a repeater system can get you into the thousands.

# Amateur Radio
The next step up is amateur radio or Ham radio. Licensing is highly recommended due to the fact you will be unable to transmit legally outside of a true emergency. That, and half the fun is practicing what you prep!

Even in a "state of emergency", transmitting is still illegal as the FCC defines it as "provide essential communication needs in connection with the immediate safety of human life and immediate protection of property when normal communication systems are not available. (Title 47, Ch 1, Subsection D, Part 97.403)" Attempting to call you buddy to ask if he has power when your cell tower is down using a repeater already designated for relief efforts will earn you a lot of heat. There are a lot of operators who wait their whole lives to be of service using their skills and will not be accommodating to you. FCC fines are typically in the $50k range. 

## Technician 
Technician is the first license and test you'll need to gain access to the 2 meter (VHF) and 70 cm (UHF) bands. These are the bread of butter of ham operators. Sure, there's regular voice to chat with a friend, but there are also repeaters and a number or very fancy digital and data modes. License requires a test and a fee, is good for 10 years, but only covers your operating station (you). You'll need to convince your friends to get licensed as well.

It is recommended that you read the Technician License manual. A general understanding of the concepts of radio frequency communication not only makes you a better operator but may help you get a signal out in a time of need! If you have a more utilitarian need for communication, GMRS is likely more your speed. Power is limited to 1500 watts but good luck finding a cost effective amplified; typically ~50 watts is good for a mobile/base station. Distances reach into the miles but can be enhanced by using a repeater (30-50 miles). Occasionally, a phenomenon called "sporadic-E" happens that allows for 100s of miles, but don't count on that for an emergency. You aren't about to phone your buddy 2 states over with VHF/UHF.
A cheap handheld (TYT, AnyTone, Radioddity, and yes, Baofeng) will cost ~$40. Depending on feature set, base stations and repeaters escalate in price rapidly. 

## General
The General License gains you access to the dark arts of HF (high frequency). The 160, 80, 40, 20, 10 meter (and others!) bands are highly subject to atmospheric conditions and even space weather! Here be dragons. A keen understanding of RF communications, propagation, and a good transmitter are instrumental to getting heard. Licensing and a fee are also required. Distances can be unlimited but are largely dependent on the antenna. Large antenna are the norm here, though a carefully considered attic dipole antenna may be good enough; everything in this realm is subjective to experience. There are people who talk to Australia from Texas on 20 watts and there are people barely audible the next state over on 500 watts. With a good station and antenna, you should be able to reach at least 100 miles if the atmosphere is cooperating. 
Costs here may be prohibitive at this stage with cheap stations starting at ~$400 and going all the way up to &gt;$10k setups. 

## Amateur-Extra
This is just General will extra privileges. The true hobbyist space.

# PMR, MURS, etc
Private mobile radio and Multi-Use Radio Service exist but are not quite as common as the others listed. They may be better suited for you if you have special requirements.

 
# Extra stuff

If you want to learn about hand held radios, ham radio, &amp; prepper comms, it's going to take an initial investment of time. You need to watch a handful of YouTube vids and absorb the basics.

Basics of Ham:

https://www.youtube.com/c/HamRadioCrashCourse

This channel has a 3 part series on studying for the Amateur Radio Technician License. Whether you get the license or not, this is the baseline knowledge needed on the subject.

CB for preppers:

Watch this 3 part series in entirety for solid information on all commo options and then a deep dive into ssb CB for preppers.

Security:

There are FCC rules that come with operating in the US, but knowledge is a good prep. This is more advanced, but gets into tactics.

Watch these vids as a baseline, then go a little deeper and watch some of the other offerings on the channels. Some of the security vids will open your eyes up to what it takes to go beyond entry level prepper comms.

Legality is an issue in normal times, so just absorb the material and remember this is a forum that explores scenarios that may include WROL (Without Rule of Law). To reiterate, there are ham forums if you want to be a hobbyist and quote FCC regs ad nausea.
