/r/Preppers users are often solicited for interviews. As a policy, the Moderation Team generally prohibits this, and we caution our users to be careful when responding to requests of this nature.

Before you respond to any request, make sure that you have confirmed the name and basic contact info of the journalist/writer and the organization  they work for. You can ask that they post a confirmation on a verified social media account, or get an email from their official email account (use a service like [10 Minute Email](https://10minutemail.com) to protect your identity.)

Confirm with them that you will remain anonymous if that is your wish, and that they will not require any personally identifying information. Also request that you have editorial control over the final piece in case they have violated any of the above. 

We, as a community, want to encourage positive stories about preppers and prepping. We would highly discourage anyone from participating in a story that might end up sensationalizing the prepping community along the lines of "Doomsday Preppers".
