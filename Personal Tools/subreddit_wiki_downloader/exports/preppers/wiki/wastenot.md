As we all mature as preppers, I wanted to share with ya'll something that I've been working on - being more conservative with my consumption, and attempting to eliminate waste.

3 main advantages here: First, it's good on the wallet. Second, it's good for the environment. And third, in a true emergency, making our consumables stretch longer and/or learning to live without them could make a huge difference.

Food management is probably my biggest weakness. I'm fairly good at rotating the pantry, but I'm bad about managing my fridge. Left-overs don't always get eaten and I'll throw out produce before my family gets to it. Recently, I've gotten better at buying only the perishables that we'll eat, meal planning, and actually eating the leftovers. There's been a huge impact on our grocery budget.

Showering - learn how to shower with less water. I showered, including washing long hair, with 2 bottles of water one time while deployed. Wasn't the best day of my life, but hey, it was a good experience. I've also worked on using my toiletries more efficiently - IE, paying attention to the amount of body wash that goes straight down the drain when it's "glopped" on, and using only the amount of shampoo needed. Again, better on the wallet and on the environment.

Managing the trash can - this could easily turn into a disaster if sanitation services are disrupted. Reducing waste, composting, buying stuff with less packaging, etc, can help on this one.

Keeping up the household - this one sounds stupid, but hear me out. I don't run the cleanest household, but do my darndest to keep things clean and the laundry caught up. If the lights and water shut off today, I know I'll have at least 2-3 weeks of clean socks/underwear before laundry becomes a pressing issue. If the lights shut off right now, I know I can walk across the house without stubbing my toes on something.

Overall, I've found that staying clean/ready/organized/efficient is a MUCH better salve for my prepper-anxiety (admit it, most of us have some) and it's just good for my mental health. I feel as if this outlook has helped me transition from "buy all the stuffs!" to a lifestyle that's both prepper-friendly and environmentally responsible.

What about you? What's important to your every-day life? How have you matured as a prepper?
