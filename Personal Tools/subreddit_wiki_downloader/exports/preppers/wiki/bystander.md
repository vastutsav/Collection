I'm seeing a lot of questions asking things that only movie and video game heros need to contend with. Remember that prepping is taking practical steps to prepare for real life problems and events. You will not be roaming the wastes, killing bad guys to save a town in distress. You'll be bored off your ass trying to not boredom-eat through your supplies.
