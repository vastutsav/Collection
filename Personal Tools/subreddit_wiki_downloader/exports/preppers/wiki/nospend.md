Ever year, my family and I do a "No-spend November". The idea is to use up and rotate some of our stash, and give our budget a breather before heading into the holidays. It usually coincides with the end of hurricane season and the ramp-up of holiday food drives, so any non-perishables that we're not going to eat before expiration gets donated.

Few excepted categories: The normal bills (mortgage, electric, etc), fresh dairy and produce, and anything for Thanksgiving dinner.

This year will probably be a bit different, as I don't feel like eating up a months' worth of our stash. However, I'm still planning on cleaning out the deep freezer and doing a one-for-one rotation on stuff that might have gotten lost in the depths of the freezer. (looking at you, frozen soups that I swore I'd eat for lunches but never did...)

I know that a lot of us are worried about how the next few weeks/months are going to shake out, but we all still need to be conservative and responsible with our resources - food/supplies and financial resources.
