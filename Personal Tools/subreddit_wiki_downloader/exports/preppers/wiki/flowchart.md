# Intro

/u/cn1ght suggested [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/5znxdo/suggestion_to_help_newcomers/) that it would be helpful to have a flowchart to help novice preppers navigate the wealth of information available, and prioritize their preparedness needs. 

This "flowchart" is for a prepper whose priorities are air, shelter, water, essential medications, food, and security in that order (see the [sticky](https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/30k9zp/welcome_to_rpreppers/) for details). It is for those who wish to prepare first for events which have frequently happened to people in the past, and later for events which have happened infrequently or never. 

It's initially a text-based "choose your own adventure" thing instead of a graphical chart because graphics are a lot harder to collaboratively edit than text, and it's currently a major work in progress. 

## Table view

* DAILY situations are just that: Normal life with no "SHTF" at all. 
* OCCASIONAL situations are those which are expected to occur more than once in an adult's life. For instance, having a power outage or an injury/illness that keeps you from working for a month are OCCASIONAL events in most parts of the world.
* RARE situations are those which happen once to some people, multiple times only to the very unlucky, and never to most people. For instance, having your house burn down or getting a disease that prevents you from working for a year.

DAILY | Probably free | [emergency fund](https://i.imgur.com/1rPEkGQ.png) | pay the bill | keep insurance | buy groceries | choose where to live
OCCASIONAL | Probably free | shelter | Store 1 gallon per person per day, rotate every 6 months | Try to store an extra month supply | Store at least 3 days worth of food, &amp; rotate | Self defense training
RARE | Consider gask mask | shelter  | Water filter | Learn to make equivalents | Stockpile + garden | Consider weapons
