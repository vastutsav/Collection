# Security
Safety and security in a disaster can be a controversial topic. In order to prep for security, first assess the threats that you're likely to face in the types of emergency that you're preparing for. 

Security is defined as "the state of being free from danger or threat", so in a prepping context security is about reducing your risk of coming to harm due to particular events or peoples' actions.

Most other preps can be regarded as providing a form of "security" -- food represents security from hunger, shelter represents security from the elements, medical preps represent some level of security from disease, and so forth.

# Securing your privacy ("opsec")
Operational Security (OPSEC) is a security and risk management process and strategy that classifies information, then determines what is required to protect sensitive information and prevent it from getting into the wrong hands. As a military term, OPSEC described strategies to prevent adversaries or potential adversaries from discovering critical operations-related data.

You should consider what information is visible about how you prep and what your plans are. Any prepper who's heard the "if a disaster happens, I'll just come to your house" joke has felt a little bit of what it's like when your information is not secure. 

To keep your privacy and information secure, be mindful of who you talk to, and be mindful of the privacy policies of any electronic media that you use as part of your recovery plans. A prepper might weigh the benefits and drawbacks and decide to keep copies of their essential documents uploaded to a cloud service in case the originals were destroyed, but they might balance the risk of identity theft by encrypting those documents with a strong but memorable password and/or key stored on another cloud service.

## OPSEC: the process!

OPSEC can further be built up by following the process outlined below:
1. Identify critical information. The first step is to determine what data would be particularly harmful if an adversary obtained it. This includes locations, stores, data, anything that might make you a target or be a gap.

2. Analyze threats. The next step is to identify who may be a threat. There may be numerous adversaries who would be envious of your situation in an emergency.

3. Analyze vulnerabilities. Examine potential weaknesses among the safeguards in place to protect your situation and identify which ones leave it vulnerable. This step includes finding any potential lapses in physical and electronic trails which may expose you to others.

4. Assess risks. The next step is to determine the threat level associated with each of the identified vulnerabilities. Rank the risks according to factors such as the chances a specific event will occur and how damaging such an event would be to your situation. The higher the risk, the more pressing is the need to implement risk management.

5. Apply appropriate countermeasures. The last step involves deploying an OPSEC plan that will reduce the risks. The best place to start is with the risks that are the biggest threat to you.

This all may sound a little daunting, but you do it everyday. It could be as simple as knowing to keep your lights out at dusk to avoid attracting attention during a power outage to complex as analyzing your bug out paths.

# Types of Security
There are two types of security: covert and overt. Think of it like this; an unassuming tractor trailer may move millions in currency without an escort because it is protected by secrecy; a BRINKS truck dares to you try. Both are effective, but utilize very different strategies to accomplish their goals. 

## Overt
This is your hollywood moment. Elaborate surveillance systems, safe rooms, bunkers, concrete walls, etc. Your home is a fortress and appears as a "hard" target to dissuade intruders. For most people, overt is not a practical method. 
For those wishing to delve into the world of tactical gear, r/TacticalGear is a good place to start.

## Covert
For practical purposes, locking windows, strengthening deadbolts and door jambs, and having good lighting around your property is likely enough to deter any unmotivated actor. It's simply not worth it with so many other places to go. These days, cameras do not appear to be the deterrent they once were, but still provide a decent benefit for the owner.

If everyone has been without water and power for a week, running your dryer with extra scented sheets is likely to draw attention. Sight, sound, and smell are very acute for humans. Be wary of any activity which may trigger one of those senses. Examples are: use of lights, cooking, radios, vehicles during events where those things may be in operable for most.

Similarly, when in public, you are much less likely to be a target if you appear to belong in the area. 


# Physical security against opportunistic thieves

Your preps can't help you if they get stolen. Balance making it difficult for unauthorized people to take your stuff, with making sure you can easily access your stuff when you need it.

# Security against "raiders"/"looters"

Looting is common in regional disasters affecting densely populated areas. Please expand this section with articles about looters in natural disasters, and steps that preppers can take to reduce the impact of looting. 

# Security against individuals with personal grudges

While "don't be the easiest target" is an effective strategy for security against an adversary looking for any old victim, there are some cases in which one individual takes a personal dislike to another and sets out to harm them. The obvious best prep against this threat is to be careful of making enemies. Learning a few basic conflict resolution skills and beefing up your interpersonal communication skills can be the difference between a nuisance neighbor and a security threat that knows when you won't be home.

# Security against action by authorities

Every prepper has a different idea of how likely it is that actions by local or federal authorities constitute a likely threat worth preparing for.
