## Intro

Well, the wiki for /r/preppers does not have a particularly comprehensive intro article, so I figured it makes sense to take a stab at creating something of that sort. This write-up is very explicitly not meant to be exhaustive; instead, it is an attempt to collect some of the most salient points about rational prepping, and then package them into an easily digestible, bite-sized form.

## Why should I prep?

That's a pretty tough one; the prepper culture sure begs to be taken with a grain of salt. It has all the makings of a doomsday cult: a tribe of unkempt misfits who hoard gold bullion, study herbalism, and preach about the imminent collapse of our society.

Most people see such worries as absurd. It's not necessarily that life-altering disasters are rare: every year, we hear about millions of people displaced by wildfires, earthquakes, hurricanes, or floods; heck, not a decade goes by without at least one first-class democracy lapsing into armed conflict or fiscal disarray. But having grown up in a period of unprecedented prosperity and calm, we take our way of life for granted - and it just feels wrong to assume that an episode of bad weather or a currency crisis could undo it all.

I think we dismiss such hazards not only because they seem surreal, but also because worrying about them makes us feel helpless and lost. What's more, we follow the same instincts to tune out far more pedestrian and avoidable risks; for example, most of us don't plan ahead for losing a job, for dealing with a week-long water outage, or for surviving the night if our home goes up in smoke.

For many of us, the singular strategy for dealing with such dangers is to pray for the government to bail us out. It's not a fundamentally misguided strategy, but the hard truth is that no state can provide a robust safety net for all of life's likely contingencies; in most places, government-run social programs are severely deficient in funding, in efficiency, and in scope. Large-scale disasters pit us against even worse odds; from New Orleans in 2005 to Fukushima in 2011, there are countless stories of people left behind due to political dysfunction, poorly allocated resources, or lost paperwork.

## So... prepping is about cowering in fear?

Ah, quite the opposite! Rational prepping is meant to give you confidence to go about your business, knowing that you are well-equipped to weather out adversities. It should not be about convincing yourself that the collapse is just around the bend, and letting that thought consume and disrupt your life.

The key is to stay positive: the world is probably not ending, you will probably not experience anything horrible in your life, and chances are, our children are going to inherit a world that's more prosperous and peaceful than the one we grew up with. But the universe is a harsh mistress, and there is only so much faith we should be putting in good fortune, in benevolent governments, or in the wonders of modern technology. So, the prepper creed is very simple: always have a backup plan.

## But it's impossible to prepare for every risk, right?

There are countless ways for things to go wrong, but we do not need to address each and every one of them. To illustrate, it should not matter if you are laid off because of a downsizing, because your new boss hates you, or because they finally catch you stealing paperclips. The outcome is still the same: you are out of a job and urgently need a way to pay your bills.

In this spirit, I found it useful to follow a very particular mental framework:

  1. Come up with a rough list of life-altering events that you think are worth worrying about. The list does not have to be complete - in fact, it doesn't really make sense to include more than about 15-20 scenarios, spanning three key categories of events:

    1. *Personal emergencies:* losing a job, having your home go up in smoke, getting into a car accident.
    2. *Regional disasters:* earthquakes, wildfires, flooding, snowstorms, power outages.
    3. *Large-scale crises:* supervolcanoes, superbugs, space zombies, global thermonuclear war.

  2. With that in hand, do some research to understand the likelihood of each of the items on your list. Rely on credible sources; doomsday prophets don't have a [particularly good track record to date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dates_predicted_for_apocalyptic_events). Cross out anything that's extremely unlikely to happen within your lifetime, or where the risk seems unknowable and entirely speculative. You will end up crossing out most of the third category on your list - and that's fine.

  3. For whatever is left on your list, try to think about the actual impact these events are going to have on your life: what problems will you need to solve, what needs will you have to fulfill? At this point, you will notice that although you started with a dizzying assortment of scenarios, you are converging on a very small number of outcomes: whether it's a period of unemployment or a shooting war with the lizardpeople, you still need a way to put food on your plate.

  4. For each of these outcomes / needs, devise a simple preparedness plan that doesn't depend on the specifics on the underlying event. When you go back and revisit the scenarios you crossed out in step #2 - the zombies and supervolcanoes - you will probably notice that your solutions would work for these situations, too.

And that's basically the trick: don't obsess about every improbable doomsday scenario ever discussed on the Internet, and don't lose sleep over what's in the news. Instead, come up with a strategy that's generic and flexible enough to cope with whatever life throws your way.

## Where do I start if I want to prep?

Emergency preparedness mostly isn't about guns, night vision gear, and pallets of canned cheese. Instead of all that, consider starting with:

  1. Low-effort lifestyle changes that help you mitigate some of the most likely risks. Take a defensive driving course before buying a seatbelt cutter tool; and stop using rickety office chairs to change lightbulbs before investing into space-age bandages to patch any eventual holes in your skull. Falls, car accidents, and accidental poisoning are some of the top killers of people between the ages of 1 and 45 - far ahead of guns, cancer, and other pop culture bogeymen.

  2. A financial safety net to survive a period of unemployment. Saving money is a painstaking process, but the bottom line is that if you set aside 10% of every post-tax paycheck, you're going to have a very robust rainy-day fund within 2-4 years. As a bonus, once you have this cushion, you will probably find out that job is not nearly as stressful as before: after all, even if they fire you, you're gonna be able to pay your bills.

  3. A modest amount of water to cope with short- to mid-term outages. It's not just for drinking: when the power is out, you might be unable to flush your toilet, too! For storage, you don't need to go overboard; pick up some gallon jugs from a grocery store for $1 and call it a day.

  4. A similarly modest amount of food to stay full when you can't go to shopping for a while. Ideally, it should be the food you like, something that packs enough calories, that stores well, and that doesn't require cooking or other extensive prep. Energy bars, canned fruit, and canned ham are some of the common picks. To avoid waste, rotate this stockpile every now and then.

  5. A habit of keeping your gas tank at least half full and having enough cash in your pocket to pay for a motel or some food - should you ever need to hit the road when the power is out and everybody else is also trying to leave town.

All of these approaches have one thing in common: they don't involve spending a lot of time or money on stuff you're probably not gonna need.

## Where should I stop?

As with any hobby, the sky's the limit, and there are folks who accept nothing short of rural, off-the-grid self-sufficiency. That said, any eventual returns on such extreme prepping strategies diminish pretty quickly. Many people will experience a multi-day power or water outage at some point in their lives; in contrast, the odds of a civilization-ending technological disaster are probably slim to none.

In practical terms, for rainy-day funds, a reasonable goal is about six months' worth of living expenses - enough to get through most run-off-the-mill economic downturns and other hiccups of that sort. For food and water, the government usually recommends at least 72 hours' worth - but aiming for 2-4 weeks is probably a safer option that comes at very little added cost.

There's an awful lot of other gear and supplies that preppers like to stockpile - from elaborate first aid kits, to firearms, to bushcraft supplies. Some of this has merit, but always be mindful of the opportunity cost: the most likely outcome is that nothing exceptionally horrible will ever happen to you. In other words, the money you spend on night vision gear is the money you might not have available when you suddenly need to fix your roof.

## Where do I learn more?

This article merely scratches the surface, and perhaps not even that; there are countless in-depth guides and some very insightful advice on anything from choosing the right water containers, to buying the right flashlight (you bet people are passionate about that!), to choosing the correct CBRN gas mask to go with your Sunday zombie dress. Check out the [remaining wiki articles](https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/wiki/index) and the sidebar (to your right) for some interesting pointers, or post your questions on the sub. For advice on savings and financial safety, /r/personalfinance is a pretty good place to visit, too.
