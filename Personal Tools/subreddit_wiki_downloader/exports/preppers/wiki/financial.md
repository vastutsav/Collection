### Every Day Financial Stability 

This isn't r/personalfinance, but check them out if you've got specific questions or a financial situation that you need help with 

Everyone needs an emergency fund. Standard industry recommendations is that you have 3-6 months worth of expenses on hand at all times. Alternatively, if your monthly expenses are low, you should also have enough cash on hand to cover your insurance deductibles (A 5% hurricane deductible can be $10,000 on a $200,000 home.) 

Write a budget, stick to it. Pay down your debts and save some money. Put a bit away for retirement. Don't sacrifice your financial stability in an effort to prep - chances are that you need the emergency fund more than you need another Amazon order. 

### Financial Emergencies 

The average individualized emergency that families will face can be bought out of. Roof sprung a leak? Pay for someone to fix it. Car break down? Buy a new (used) one. Someone get sick? Pay medical bills. None of these things are pleasant, but none of them are outside of what ordinary people will face during their lifetimes. Having an emergency fund will get you through these types of situations. 

Maintaining good credit is important, too. I personally don't go crazy trying to inch up my credit score, but I do take care to pay my bills on time and not make my credit bad. Worst case, I could take out a loan to cover my family's expenses. 

### Alternative investments
There's always a push within the community for alternative investments, such as bitcoin and precious metals. I personally have stayed away from Bitcoin, as there's no way of spending it if the power is out. Precious metals can be a reasonable investment in inflationary times, but be sure to maintain balance here, too. If investing in gold/silver is your goal, make sure it's within proportion to the rest of your assets (pantry, savings account, retirement, etc). 

### Protecting yourself in a localized disaster 

Insurance. You need insurance for anything that you can't afford to cover yourself. Health insurance, car insurance, homeowners insurance, and term life insurance. Know what your policy covers, know what co-pays or deductibles apply, and know who to contact in case of an emergency. I don't carry my entire insurance policy in my go-bag, but I do have my homeowners contact info written down. In today's world of electronic banking, almost anything can be accessed from a mobile phone with an internet connection. If the situation is bad enough that there's no mobile phone access, chances are that contacting your insurance company isn't your first priority, anyway. 

### Prepping for financial collapse 

This is a tricky one, depending on what you think a collapse is going to look like. During the 2008 mortgage crisis, those who weathered the storm the best were those who were not over-leveraged and who had more savings than debt. Having a good, reliable and practical skill as a source of income can also help. For example, those working in tech and finance had a MUCH harder time finding a new job than those working in jobs like plumbing and manufacturing. 

Diversification is important. Within the financial world, this can be seen as mutual funds over individual stocks/bonds, or adding real estate to your portfolio. While this may protect against market conditions, it's not going to help in a collapse type situation. Owning precious metals is a common hedge, but the practicalness of gold or silver has yet to be seen in a total market collapse situation. Precious metals have the same problem as currency - they have to be trade-able in order to be worth something, and you can't eat gold. Same thing with BitCoin or other cryptocurrencies. Fantastic if the economic problem is isolated (like Greece or Venezuela) but not so good if it's a world-wide or prolonged issue. 

Beyond that, prepping to homestead and be as self sufficient is going to be the best prep for complete and total financial collapse. Hard skills - like woodworking or butchery - can be multiplied and traded a lot faster than consumable goods. Keep enough of a stockpile of food/supplies on hand to get through whatever time period you think you need to start re-growing and re-building on your own land/with your community.
